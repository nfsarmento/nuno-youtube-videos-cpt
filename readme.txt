== Description ==

I have tried to keep this plugin as simple as possible, you are not going to be overwhelmed with options like some of the video player plugins out there.

This plugin allows you to create a custom post type 'videos' to be used on posts and pages as shortcode. The video CPT allows you to choose youtube, vimeo or dailymotion videos.
